# Maze-Generator

Many gaming applications require 2dimensional n by m mazes with no cycles (the no cycles
requirement creates a class of tough mazes with a single unique solution). These mazes are
then the target of maze solving games or used by maze solving algorithms. One problem is
generating a large library of mazes to be used by the games or to test the algorithms. There are that
algorithms exist to generate random mazes. In this project we will implement one of these
algorithms.
